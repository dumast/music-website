## Music portfolio (Next.js)

Single-page music portfolio with sections for:

- Weekly covers (Instagram / TikTok / YouTube Shorts)
- Original music (album in progress + released intro song)
- Longer YouTube videos
- Contact/social links

Most of the site content lives in [src/content/site.ts](src/content/site.ts).

---

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Update your name, bio, and links in `src/content/site.ts`. The homepage renders from that config.
